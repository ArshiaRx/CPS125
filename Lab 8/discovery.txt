Q1. explain why you need to send the sixe to a function that accepts a numerical array.
Answer:

We need to give the size of the array because the complier needs to allocate space in the memory which 
is not possible without knowing the size. Compiler determines the size required for an array with the 
help of the number of elements of an array and the size of the data type present in the array.	


Q2. explain you need a '\0' at the end of a string.
Answer:

You need to end C strings with '\0' since this is how the library knows where the string ends without
it, the program will be having a undefined behaviour.
